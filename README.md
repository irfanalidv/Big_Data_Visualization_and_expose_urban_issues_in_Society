# Big_Data_Visualization_and_expose_urban_issues_in_Society

**Data visualization** is an important way for architects, planners, and policy experts to communicate with the public and its use has increased dramatically. This is due to the explosion of **“big data”**, the open data movement that provides greater access to government data, new tools for developing static and interactive data visualizations that invite public participation, and the current media culture that supports the consumption of information through visual snapshots.

We will be working with **“Big Data”** to answer or expose urban issues.  

During this project we will learn technical skills which involves us working with **“Big Data”** such as cleaning and aggregating data in **python**, **D3.js** and other **web-based visualization software**, and accessing **API’s** to download big data.
